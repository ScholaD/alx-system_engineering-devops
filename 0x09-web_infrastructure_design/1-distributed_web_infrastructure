The distribution algorithm the load balancer is configured with and how it works.
The HAProxy load balancer is configured with the Round Robin distribution algorithm
The setup enabled by the load-balancer.
The HAProxy load-balancer is enabling an Active-Passive setup rather than an Active-Active setup
How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works.
A Primary-Replica setup configures one server to act as the Primary server and the other server to act as a Replica of the Primary server.

The difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application.
The Primary node is responsible for all the write operations the site needs whilst the Replica node is capable of processing read operations, which decreases the read traffic to the Primary node.


There are multiple SPOF (Single Point Of Failure).
For example, if the Primary MySQL database server is down, the entire site would be unable to make changes to the site (including adding or removing users). The server containing the load balancer and the application server connecting to the primary database server are also SPOFs.
Security issues.
The data transmitted over the network isn't encrypted using an SSL certificate so hackers can spy on the network. There is no way of blocking unauthorized IPs since there's no firewall installed on any server.
No monitoring.
We have no way of knowing the status of each server since they're not being monitored.
